# ðŸ“Œ Applied Algorithm (AA) - Course Code Repository  

Welcome to the **Applied Algorithm (AA)** repository! This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations used in the **Applied Algorithm** course of SoICT, HUST. It includes solutions for various problem-solving paradigms such as **Backtracking, Graph Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and Bitmasking**.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents  

The repository is structured into different categories based on algorithmic paradigms:  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Backtracking  
- Solves combinatorial problems using recursion and state-space exploration.  
- **Examples:**  
  - BalanceAssignment
  - Bus Router  
 

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Graph Algorithms  
- Covers fundamental graph traversal and shortest path algorithms.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
  - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm  
  - Kruskal's and Primâ€™s Algorithm  

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Divide and Conquer  
- Breaks problems into smaller subproblems and solves them recursively.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
  - Binary Search  
  - Closest Pair of Points  

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Dynamic Programming (DP)  
- Optimized solutions using overlapping subproblems and memoization.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Knapsack Problem  
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)  
  - Matrix Chain Multiplication  

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Bitmasking  
- Uses bitwise operations for optimization and state representation.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Bitmask DP  
  - Subset Problems  
  - XOR-based Algorithms
